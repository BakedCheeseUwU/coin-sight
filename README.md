CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# clerk redirect url

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

```

      - Log in to your Clerk account.
      - Navigate to the dashboard or settings page.

6. Install Project Dependencies using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` or `yarn install --legacy-peer-deps`.

7. Migrate database:

In terminal, run `npm run db:generate` to generate database client and `npm run db:migrate` to make sure that your database is up-to-date along with schema.

8. Run the Seed Script:

In the same terminal, run the following command to execute the seed script:

`npm run db:seed`

This command uses `npm` to execute the Typescript file (`scripts/seed.ts`) and writes transaction data in database.

9. Verify Data in Database:

Once the script completes, check your database to ensure that the transaction data has been successfully seeded.

10. Now app is fully configured üëç and you can start using this app using either one of `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
